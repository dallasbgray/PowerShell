# PowerShell
Powershell scripts I have written and/or found useful

- `file-in-vim.ps1` is a simple menu I wrote to navigate to a pre-defined directory, search for a file, and open the file in Vim (Vim should be installed). It still has a few bugs with user-input and searching files, but it is usable and saves me about 5 whole seconds.
