# Scripts
Powershell and Zsh/Bash scripts I have written and found useful

- `AURpacman.sh`

- `file-in-vim.ps1` is a simple menu I wrote to navigate to a directory, search for, and open the file in Vim. It still has a few bugs with user-input and searching files, but it is usable and saves me about 5 whole seconds.
